Issues
======

This repo is no longer a point of contact for support issues.

Please do not file issues here.  (Oh right, you can't.)

All past two-hundred-plus issues that search engines might have directed you here to see; 
oops, we removed those without archiving them.

It's as if millions of voices cried out for support, and were suddenly silenced.

Feel free to report your feedback on how well we are providing support to /dev/null.

Also, if you are a current customer looking to trigger an App (re)build without pushing a commit, don't look at http://blog.wercker.com/triggering-builds-with-the-wercker-api because that's not available for all stacks.

### Wercker CLI
