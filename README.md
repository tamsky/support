Issues
======

This repo is no longer a point of contact for support issues.
Please do not file issues here.  (Oh right, you can't.)
All past issues that search engines might have directed you here to see; oops, we removed those without archiving them.

It's as if millions of voices cried out for support, and were suddenly silenced.

Feel free to report your feedback on how well we are providing support to /dev/null.

Also, if you are a current customer looking to trigger an App (re)build without pushing a commit, don't look at http://blog.wercker.com/triggering-builds-with-the-wercker-api because that's not available for all stacks.

### Wercker CLI

If you are experiencing issues running wercker locally, please submit a support ticket using the "Contact Us" link at https://wercker.uservoice.com/forums/181077-general

- Which OS are you using?
- Which Docker environment are you using? (Boot2docker, custom, etc)
- Create a gist containing the following information:
  - The entire log when running wercker with the `--debug` log. (ie. `wercker --debug build`)
  - The wercker.yml file that causes the issues.

### Wercker Web

If you are experiencing issues running builds or deploys on hosted wercker,
please do the following:

Try running the build again to see if the error occurs again. If it does, turn
on support for the application, and submit a support ticket using the "Contact Us" link at https://wercker.uservoice.com/forums/181077-general with the following information:

- The application owner and application name.
- The ID of the build or deploy that failed.
