Issues
======

If you are experiencing issues running wercker locally, please create a issue
containing the following:

- Which OS are you using?
- Which Docker environment are you using? (Boot2docker, custom, etc)
- Create a gist containing the following information:
  - The entire log when running wercker with the `--debug` log. (ie. `wercker --debug build`)
  - The wercker.yml file that causes the issues.

If you are experiencing issues running builds or deploys on hosted wercker,
please do the following:

Try running the build again to see if the error occurs again. If it does, turn
on support for the application, and create an issue with the following
information:

- The application owner and application name.
- The ID of the build or deploy that failed.

If you want to create a private bug report do the same as above, but instead
create an issue using uservoice.
